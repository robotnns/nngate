1  IDAT length

  2  "IDAT" in ascii (literally the bytes 0x49 0x44 0x41 0x54)

 3   Zlib header 0x78 0x01

Steps 4-7 are for every deflate block, as the data may need to be broken up:

 4   The byte 0x00 or 0x01, depending on if it is a middle or the last block.

5    Number of bytes in block (up to 2^16-1) stored as a little endian 16-bit integer

 6   The 1's complement of this integer representation.

 7   Image data (each scan-line is starts with a zero-byte for the no filter option in PNG, and is followed by width bytes of greyscale pixel data)

8    An adler-32 checksum of all the image data

9    A CRC of all the IDAT data
o
An additional "filter-type" byte is added to the beginning of every scanline (see Filtering). 
The filter-type byte is not considered part of the image data, but it is included in the datastream sent to the compression step. 

PNG allows the image data to be filtered before it is compressed. Filtering can improve the compressibility of the data. The filter step itself does not reduce the size of the data. All PNG filters are strictly lossless.

PNG defines several different filter algorithms, including "None" which indicates no filtering. The filter algorithm is specified for each scanline by a filter-type byte
that precedes the filtered scanline in the precompression datastream. An intelligent encoder can switch filters from one scanline to the next. The method for choosing which filter to employ is up to the encoder.
